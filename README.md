App prototype for cinephiles and movie hobbyists.

## Dependency Manager
We're using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) as a _decentralized_ dependency manager.
+ Run `carthage update`. This will fetch dependencies into a [Carthage/Checkouts](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#carthagecheckouts) folder and build each one or download a pre-compiled framework.
